/*
In Q condition is given if no char is common then return "".

here we are initializing the first string from the string of arrays into a variable string first and a flag set to true
flag is telling whether itâ€™s safe to add the current letter to result if it matches it will be added until it get false and the loop is
breaked . An if ccondition is working until flag is true and the char is added to the res string.

we are taking two for loops in which the first one is for comparing each alpahabet of first string with rest of the strings alphabet and the
second loop is for iterating  rest of the strings for comparision
